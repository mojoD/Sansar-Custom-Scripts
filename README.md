C# Code for Project Sansar

This repository has my code I have been doing inside of the Linden Labs Project Sansar Virtual World Software.

AlgoRaver - Live Music Coding in Sansar.  This program uses the Chat Window as a UI to be able to control loops that play samples, instruments and other special comands.  The musician can type in commands that create a set of beats or full songs.  The musician can have live performances in Sansar using this program to create EDM Music.
